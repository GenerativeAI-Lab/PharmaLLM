# PharmaLLM
A Medicine Prescriber Chatbot Exploiting Open-Source Large Language Models

The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare presents both opportunities and challenges. While LLM-powered applications are being utilized for various medical tasks, concerns persist regarding their accuracy and reliability, particularly when not specifically trained on medical data. Using open-source models without proper fine-tuning for medical applications can lead to inaccurate or potentially harmful advice, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. Therefore, this study addresses these issues by developing PharmaLLM, a fine-tuned version of the open-source Llama 2 model, designed to provide accurate medicine prescription information. PharmaLLM incorporates a multi-modal input/output mechanism, supporting both text and speech, to enhance accessibility. The system demonstrated strong performance metrics, achieving 87% accuracy, 92.16% F1 score, 94% sensitivity, 66% specificity, and 90% precision. A usability study involving 33 participants was conducted to evaluate the system using the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire, focusing on error handling, response generation, navigation, and personality. Results from the questionnaire indicated that participants found the system easy to navigate and the responses useful and relevant. PharmaLLM aims to facilitate improved patient-physician interactions, particularly in areas with limited healthcare resources and low literacy rates. This research contributes to the advancement of medical informatics by offering a reliable, accessible web-based tool that benefits both patients and healthcare providers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
